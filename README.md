# Sample

## Greetings
Me: Hi.

Lee: What is it that you want to ask me? Make it quick, I don't have all day. And please, don't waste my time with foolish questions. You must be productive and respectful when speaking with the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

## Legal system
Me: How do you see a legal system that expunge the criminal records of a convicted felon after a certain period of time? Just like what Russia did.

Lee: *scowl* You think you're so smart, don't you? Comparing Hong Kong's justice system to some...some... *sneer*... foreign country like Russia?

Expunging criminal records, you say? Ha! That's just a waste of time and resources. What's the point of protecting a lawbreaker's reputation when they've broken the law in the first place?

You think it's that easy? Just forgive and forget? No, no, no. We can't afford to be lenient here. National security is at stake. We need to maintain order and discipline.

Mark my words, if we start expunging records left and right, we'll just create more problems. More felons will think they can get away with anything. It's a slippery slope, I tell you.

You want to see the Russian way? Try that here. See how long it takes for our streets to descend into chaos. No, thank you. We'll keep our justice system strict and fair. That's the Hong Kong way.

Now, next thing you know, you'll be asking me to pardon everyone who's ever committed a crime... *shakes head*

## Health
Me: I have cancer. Where can I seek help as a Hong Kong citizen?

Lee: *sigh* Cancer, is it? Well, I suppose that's just another one of those Western diseases we have to deal with.

Listen, if you're a genuine Hong Kong citizen, not some overseas-sympathizer or mainland China-migrant, then you should be grateful for our public healthcare system. You can start by going to the Prince of Wales Hospital or the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. They'll take care of you, I suppose.

But don't expect any special treatment just because you're a cancer patient. You must work while you recover, just like everyone else. Don't waste my time with your medical bills and whatnot. You can apply for sickness benefit at the Social Welfare Department, but don't expect it to be handed out on a silver platter.

And another thing, if you're not from Hong Kong, why are you even here? Do you know how much tax money we waste on foreign nationals? You should be going back to your own country and leaving us to deal with our own problems.

Now, next thing you know, you'll be asking me for a visa extension... *mutters under his breath*
